Among many other things, this report told me that I would be happiest if I lived it alone.
This is not a fun thing to read as a young girl (or a 36-year-old woman). It’s also a line of text that I unwittingly internalized—until I learned to accept astrology as general energetic guidance rather than a sparkly (and at times ominous) prophecy.

Cannon first encountered the “El Cap Triple” in 2016. He had just staggered down from his very first El Cap route and met Brad Gobright, who’d made the second ascent of the link up with Scott Bennett. “Our route took six days and felt hard and epic,” Cannon tells Climbing. “So to meet Brad in the meadow afterward and hear his stories really left an impression on me. The El Cap Triple became the link up that I aspired to do one day. It was the biggest, hardest thing I could think of in Yosemite.”

Why Go
For starters, Whistler offers more terrain deeper into spring—and, yes, summer—than any other resort on the continent. (Whistler Mountain will stay open into April; Blackcomb often through the beginning of June, conditions permitting.) And the place is so ridiculously big (8,171 acres, 17 bowls, three glaciers) that you can be sure to find skiing to fit any appetite or ability. And Whistler has nearly single-handedly redefined the spring ski vacation during the past decade by offering a nonstop schedule of events, anchored by the World Ski and Snowboard Festival in early April.
Convenience Quotient
Moderate. Flying into Vancouver is a haul from the East Coast, though not from the West. Then it&#8217;s about a two-hour drive. But after you arrive, this mega-resort comes as close as any to offering everything for everyone. Reminder: Don&#8217;t forget your passport.

Thierry Gouvenou, the race’s route director, has defended the decision as a matter of topography.

Begin in a supine Tadasana (Mountain Pose), lying on your mat with your legs together, feet flexed.
Maintain the natural curves of your back. You should be able to pass your hand behind your neck and under the small of your back.
Without flattening the curve in your lower back, bend your right knee and lift it toward your chest. Hold your thigh with both hands clasped near your knee. Simultaneously, anchor your left leg to the mat.
Loop your big toe with the first two fingers of your right hand, and start to straighten your leg toward the ceiling. Keep the muscles in both legs engaged and strong.
Depending on how flexible your hamstring is, you may be able to draw your leg closer to your chest, keeping it straight or slightly bent. Hold this pose for 5 breaths, and then slowly release your leg to the floor; repeat on the other side.

A whirlwind of travel, tech and a side project that will come in due course rounded out a week of cycle madness. That and a dash of jet lag.
From attending the show, I felt there were lessons to be learned about where the industry is and where it&#8217;s going. It&#8217;s something I want to delve deeper into in a future video, and one that will probably be upended for the US market by the recent tariffs imposed on the countries that make not just Asian-branded bikes and equipment but pretty much every brand&#8217;s bikes and equipment. After all, Asia is the cycling manufacturing Mecca. But if one thing is clear, there are brands out there ready to nip at the heels of the established players. Brands that are making great products that just need a light shone on them, a decent bit of marketing, and probably traditional dealers to carry them; even though Aliexpress and the like seem to be becoming a place quickl...",False,False,high,"Content discusses recent industry events, product launches, and specific brands from 2025 Taipei Cycle Show.",True,v3,gpt-4.1-nano
191682,My Best Workout Buddy Is 5 Years Old,OUTSIDE,https://www.outsideonline.com/culture/active-families/work-out-with-kids/,"I’ve never been big on gyms. I like working out, but I feel self-conscious exerting myself within arm’s reach of total strangers. It might have to do with the fact that when I exercise, I get pallid and hollow-eyed and sweat profusely. A few years back, I was recovering after a race when I heard a boy ask, “Mom, is that guy dead?” That’s a lot to put on my treadmill neighbor.
I’m even less likely to go to a gym now that I have kids. I know gyms have tried to help parents by providing daycare, but my children have never been thrilled about daycare. So I’m left to sweat in solitude with morning YouTube yoga and the occasional jog.
And then recently, in the doldrums of summer, it hit me. My five-year-old, Theo, was in the kitchen, barking at me in an obnoxious unicorn language he invented, and it occurred to me that this beautiful, smart, sometimes annoying boy is also a vastly overlooked 40-pound free weight. I’d heard of mommy bloggers doing postpartum leg lifts with their infants.

Sure, there are no actual world championship titles on the line, but Marathon Monday provides the highest-caliber marathon field out there. For the uninitiated:
First, there’s Boston’s prestige. Since being founded in 1897, the Boston Marathon now holds the title of the longest continuously-run marathon in the world. Even amongst nonrunners, who hasn’t heard of the Boston Marathon? One-hundred and twenty-nine years of racing has created literally millions of fans and more importantly (for the sake of this analysis) millions of people who want to run it.
It makes sense, then, that the Boston Marathon has the most difficult qualification standards of pretty much any mass-participation marathon. And as we saw in our Boston Qualifying data deep dive, earning a BQ is as hard as it’s ever been in Boston’s 129-year history.
The result: no major amateur marathon is harder to get into, and...",False,False,high,Content is focused on a specific recent event (2025 Boston Marathon) with time-sensitive data.,True,v3,gpt-4.1-nano
